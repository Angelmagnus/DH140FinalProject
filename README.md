# DH140FinalProject
Github Repository For DH140 Final Project by Angel Coronado

## Topic: Astronaut Records

#### Dataset:
In 2022, the Sam Donald released a data set that archived the information on Astronauts from multiple organizations and included data on various astronauts' occupation, mission hours, military status and other personal information. Note that this data is only updated up until 2020. This data set can be accessed here:

#### Motivation
As an Aerospace Engineering major with an emphasis with Astronautics I have studied various space systems and had to do analysis on many systems that go into space. I find this set interesting as it connects to the concepts I've learned in my major courses.

#### Questions:
In this project I will answer the following questions:
* What country has the most mission time?
* What is the average year of age of astronauts during their mission?
* How many astronauts had extravehicular activities (EVAs)? What is the average amount they spent doing EVAs?
* What shuttles were used the most?
