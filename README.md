# DH140FinalProject
Github Repository For DH140 Final Project by Angel Coronado

## Interests for Final Project
A few topics of interest for the final project that I have include:
* Evolution of flight
* History of population growth in US
* Statistics related to US wars

However if a more, Digital Humanities related topic were to be pursued, then I would be interested to look into the article below for more information and data on current AI technology.

I could find data for information such as tweets about AI currently by scraping Twitter APIs and performing a sentiment analysis on the resulting data. Below are a few articles on the topic of scraping APIs and where to start.

An example of a few datasets that already exist that I could use for more concrete and clean data for the final project are shown in the table below.

 Name of Dataset | Data Description/Investigation | Link to data 
 :---: | :---:| :---: 
 Eastern State Penitentiary Admission Book A| Record of criminals; includes, names, crime, sentence. I think I would look for trends in the data to see if certain groups were targeted more by the justice system|  https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/22/
 Nixon White House Tapes|Data on the title, time and date of recording, audiotape, recording device, geographic coordinates, participants, and a brief descriptive statement. It would be interesting to see where more conversations occured and how it correlates with major events of the Nixon Administration| https://www.archives.gov/open/nixon/37-wht-dataset-conversationlist.html
